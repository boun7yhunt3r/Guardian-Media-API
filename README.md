Analytics on "Brexit" article popularity over years using Guardian API.

Did some basic analytics on Brexit popularity using data collected from Guardian API.

I havent got time to do more analytics on the same. Looking forward to work on finding unusual trends or spikes in article count over years.
Feel free to add code to the repo.
